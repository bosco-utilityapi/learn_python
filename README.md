# Learn Python #

Learn Python by writing tests first and then implementing the solution as per [testfirst.org](http://testfirst.org/). Ported from Alex Chaffee's [learn_ruby](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby).

The lessons are stored in distinct directory, numbered in order of increasing difficulty:

* 00_hello
* 01_temperature
* 02_calculator
* 03_simon_says
* _etc_

In each directory, run the test_*.py file on the command line. For example:
```
$ cd 00_hello
$ ./test_hello.py
```

Implement `hello.py` a little bit at a time and fix the errors indicated by `test_hello.py` one by one by until there are no more errors. If you are stuck, take a look at the `xx_solution` branch. For example, the `00_solution` branch contains a `hello.py` that passes all the tests in `test_hello.py`.
